# Now it's time to build various models for predicting casual and registered separately. 
# Their sum is our responce, count, and we'll carpture more variance and will 
# be able to make better predictions if we predict them separately and then add together.

# First the test and training sets were used to build models and evaluate their performance.
# Then same models were trained on all the provided labeled data in order to increase accuracy. 
# The code has models trained on all the data already, and therefore contains only optimistic 
# estimates of RMSLE. During the model selection training and testing sets were used as well 
# for "real" estimate.
